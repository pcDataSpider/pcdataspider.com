       <div><p>This is the home for the Data Spider data acquisition module.</p>


       <p>The Data Spider module incorporates a programmable controller (<a href='http://www.parallax.com/microcontrollers/propeller'>Propeller</a> from Parallax) along with a dedicated circuitry to process the different electrical signals and communicate with a computer via a USB link. The module is pre-programmed with a standard firmware and a standard set of instructions, but can also be custom-programmed to perform specific functions or respond to specific commands. The module also comes with a simple data acquisition software that can run on almost any personal computer. This software is written in Python and is offered as Open Source Software. All code can be found on our github site, <a href='https://github.com/pcDataSpider'>here</a>.</p></div>
