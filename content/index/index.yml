       <div><p>This is the home for the DataSpider data acquisition module.</p>
       
       <p>The DataSpider acts as an interface between a computer and other instruments or sensors.</p>


       <p>The Data Spider module incorporates a programmable controller (<a href='http://www.parallax.com/microcontrollers/propeller'>Propeller</a> from Parallax) along with a dedicated circuitry to process the different electrical signals and communicate with a computer via a USB link. The module is pre-programmed with a standard firmware and a standard set of instructions, but can also be custom-programmed to perform specific functions or respond to specific commands. The module also comes with a simple data acquisition software written in Python that can run on almost any personal computer.
       </p>
       <p>The DataSpider module and its associated software is offered as Open Source. All code can be found on our github site, <a href='https://github.com/pcDataSpider'>here</a>. We are currently working on releasing as well all documentation and design files for the hardware.</p></div>
